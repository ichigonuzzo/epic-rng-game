## 🔄 Rebirth System (11 Layers)

The rebirth system is the core progression mechanism of Epic RNG Game. Each layer offers unique challenges and rewards:

### Layer Structure

1. **Layer 1 - Novice**: Starting layer with basic point generation
2. **Layer 2 - Apprentice**: 2x point multiplier, unlocks basic bonuses
3. **Layer 3 - Journeyman**: 5x multiplier, improved RNG ranges
4. **Layer 4 - Expert**: 10x multiplier, bonus click effects
5. **Layer 5 - Master**: 25x multiplier, auto-click features
6. **Layer 6 - Grandmaster**: 50x multiplier, special RNG modes
7. **Layer 7 - Legend**: 100x multiplier, mega bonuses
8. **Layer 8 - Mythic**: 250x multiplier, epic rewards
9. **Layer 9 - Cosmic**: 500x multiplier, universe-bending bonuses
10. **Layer 10 - Transcendent**: 1000x multiplier, reality-altering effects
11. **Layer 11 - Eternal**: Ultimate layer with infinite potential

### Rebirth Benefits

- **Point Multipliers**: Each layer dramatically increases point generation
- **Improved RNG**: Higher layers unlock better random number ranges
- **Special Abilities**: Unique mechanics and bonuses per layer
- **Prestige Points**: Gain permanent bonuses that persist across rebirths
- **Unlock Conditions**: Each layer has specific requirements to unlock

### Strategic Considerations

- **Timing**: Rebirth too early and miss potential; too late and waste time
- **Preparation**: Build up resources before attempting higher layers
- **Efficiency**: Balance current gains with future potential
- **Risk vs Reward**: Higher layers offer better rewards but take longer to achieve
